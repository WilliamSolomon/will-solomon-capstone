# Project Title
WeatherCap App

## Overview

For my BrainStation software development capstone, I developed WeatherCapâ€”an app designed for photography enthusiasts to receive alerts and track specific weather conditions

### Problem

Have you ever dreamt of capturing foggy shots of the Manhattan Bridge, reflections of the Empire State Building in rain puddles, or the perfect sunset against a partly cloudy sky? The challenge lies in remembering to watch out for ideal weather conditions amidst life's busyness or planning an outing only to find unfavorable weather conditions on the day. WeatherCap solves this dilemma by keeping you informed and prepared for spontaneous or planned photo outings.

### User Profile

- Hobby Photographers:
    - be alerts to specific weather conditions happeing in the next 7 days
    - be alerts to weather changes for a specific date

### Features

As a user, I want to be able to:
- select my location
- receive a weather forecast
- create an account to manage my alerts and alert settings

As a logged in user, I want to be able to:
- select weather conditions to monitor for
- receive alerts when not logged in 
- retain settings after the browser is closed
- delete/dismiss alerts

### Auth

JWT Authentication:
- JWT authentication will be implemented to secure API endpoints.
- Before adding authentication, all API requests will utilize a default user with ID 1 for testing purposes.
- Authentication will be added after the core features of the system have been initially implemented and tested.
- Upon successful login, the JWT token will be stored in the localStorage of the browser.
- The JWT token will be removed from localStorage when the user logs out.
- Different UI states will be implemented based on the user's authentication status to provide appropriate functionality and access control as depicted in the mockups.
